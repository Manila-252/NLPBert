# NLPBert
Fine-tuned a DistilBERT model for sentiment classification on Romanized Nepali restaurant reviews. Initially explored parameter-efficient fine-tuning of LLaMA-2 using LoRA/QLoRA, but pivoted due to GPU memory constraints, demonstrating practical model selection under limited hardware resources.
